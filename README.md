## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the Adult Income Dataset to analyze the factors that influence whether an individual earns more than $50K per year.  
The analysis focuses on demographic, educational, and work-related attributes using Python and Pandas.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Records: ~32,000
- Features include:
  - Age
  - Education
  - Workclass
  - Occupation
  - Hours per week
  - Gender
  - Marital status
  - Income (>50K or <=50K)

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
The following steps were performed:
- Removed unnecessary columns (`capital-gain`, `capital-loss`)
- Handled missing values
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Converted categorical values where needed

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key questions explored:
- Does age affect income level?
- Which education level is most associated with higher income?
- Is working more hours per week linked to higher income?
- Income comparison between males and females
- Impact of marital status on income
- Most common occupations among individuals earning >50K

## 📈 Visualizations
The analysis includes:
- Histogram of age distribution
- Bar charts comparing education level vs income
- Boxplots for hours worked per week by income category

## 💡 Key Insights
- Higher income is more common among individuals aged 35–55
- Advanced education levels (Bachelors, Masters, Doctorate) are strongly associated with higher income
- Working more hours per week generally correlates with higher income, but not always
- Males show a higher proportion of >50K income compared to females
- Married individuals tend to have higher income levels

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚧 Limitations
- Dataset is relatively old and may not reflect current income distributions
- Income is represented as a binary category (>50K or <=50K)
- No geographic salary adjustments included

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and insight generation.  
It serves as a foundational portfolio project for an aspiring data analyst.
